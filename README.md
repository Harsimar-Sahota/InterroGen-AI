## 📈 Future Improvements (Planned)

The following items are planned design improvements and are not yet implemented:

- Rate limiting on AI endpoints
- Background job queues for heavy AI calls
- Caching frequently accessed sessions
- Dockerized deployment setup
- CI/CD pipeline integration

---

## 🔐 Security Practices

This project follows standard backend security practices:
- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Protected API routes
- Environment-based secrets
- No credentials committed to the repository

## 💡 Inspiration

Inspired by **Y Combinator’s RFS** (Request for Startups) focusing on **Vertical SaaS and AI tools for real-world workflows**.

This project aligns with the idea of building practical, focused AI products that help users solve real problems efficiently rather than generic, one-size-fits-all solutions.
